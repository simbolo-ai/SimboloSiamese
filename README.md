Here's an extended version of your text with additional information about Burmese-to-Romanization:

Provides a tool for syllable-based tokenization of Burmese text. It breaks down Burmese text into individual syllables, facilitating language processing tasks such as text analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) for Burmese.

### Features
- Syllable Tokenization: Tokenizes Burmese text into syllables based on Unicode rules. It helps in language segmentation and provides a clear framework for analyzing Burmese sentences in a structured manner.

- Efficient Processing: Designed to handle large text efficiently with minimal memory overhead, making it scalable for tasks involving big data or large-scale text analysis.

- Burmese Unicode Support: Fully supports Burmese script and syllable rules as defined by the Burmese Unicode standard, ensuring that the tokenization aligns with native Burmese text structure.

- Burmese-to-Romanization: Converts Burmese script into its Romanized equivalent, facilitating pronunciation guidance and helping non-native speakers understand Burmese text. The Romanization process follows the standard linguistic rules for Burmese phonetic transcription, offering a bridge for users unfamiliar with the Burmese script to read, pronounce, and comprehend the language. This feature can be particularly useful for language learners, cross-lingual applications, and linguistic studies that require Romanized Burmese text.
